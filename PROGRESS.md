# Progress log

This file is the project's memory between sessions. Read it (and
[MILESTONES.md](MILESTONES.md)) at the start of every session; append an entry at the end of
every session.

Entry format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <milestone>
- Done: what was completed this session
- Next: the immediate next steps
- Known issues: open problems, workarounds, anything that will bite later
```

Newest entries go first.

## 2026-06-12 — M0 closed

- Done: **M0 complete — `make dev-up && make e2e-smoke` passes (all 19 checks).**
  - Monorepo scaffold: single Go module (ADR-001), Makefile, pinned tool versions.
  - Platform libraries: `platform/proto` (canonical Document protobuf + buf, generated code
    committed, CI drift check), `platform/tenancy` (tenant chokepoint, strict claim
    validation with syntax allowlist per ADR-002, 100% statement coverage), `platform/config`
    (env loader, 100%), `platform/telemetry` (OTel init + HTTP middleware, no-op safe, ~83%).
  - Dev stack (compose): Redpanda, Postgres, MinIO, Redis, Keycloak (realm auto-import:
    `asker` realm, `asker-web` client + audience mapper, dev users alice/bob), Vespa
    (streaming mode, app package deploys via `vespa/deploy.sh`), TEI. All healthchecked;
    all host ports bound to 127.0.0.1; memory-capped to fit small Docker VMs (ADR-003 §5).
  - Gateway: OIDC JWT validation (issuer+JWKS split per ADR-003 §3), tenant only from
    verified claims, `/healthz` `/readyz` `/v1/me`, distroless image with self-probe
    healthcheck. Tests cover forged-signature, alg=none, HS256, expired/iss/aud attacks.
  - CI: lint (golangci-lint v2 + buf lint + proto drift check), test + coverage gate
    (tenancy ==100%, platform libs >=75%), build + trivy scan, compose e2e smoke job.
  - Smoke test proves: stack health, OIDC password grant -> tenant == token `sub`,
    401 without token, and Vespa streaming-group tenant isolation (feed as tenant A,
    query as tenant B -> 0 hits; delete propagates).
  - Adversarial review (5 dimensions, every finding skeptic-verified): 14 confirmed
    findings all fixed (incl. 0.0.0.0 port bindings, nonexistent trivy-action ref,
    duplicate duration metric, tenant syntax validation); 8 false positives rejected.
- Next: **M1 — vertical slice.** Upload + Gmail connectors -> ingest -> chunk -> embed ->
  Vespa index -> query service (hybrid search) -> web UI. Tombstone/delete flow. The sacred
  cross-tenant leakage suite. Control-plane Postgres schema and `platform/kafkautil` /
  `platform/crypto` libs will be needed early.
- Known issues:
  - CI has never executed on GitHub (no remote configured yet) — workflows are authored and
    locally validated (lint/test/gate/smoke all green locally) but unproven on Actions
    runners; first push should watch the e2e job's disk/memory headroom.
  - The primary dev machine's Docker VM (8GB, shared with other stacks) cannot fit
    `BAAI/bge-m3`; a gitignored `deploy/compose/.env` pins `TEI_MODEL_ID=BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`
    locally (ADR-003 §6). Raise Docker Desktop memory to >=12GB to run the real default.
    Embedding dimension (384 vs 1024) starts to matter in M1 when vectors land in Vespa.
  - TEI runs under amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon (no arm64 CPU image) — fine for dev,
    slow for bulk embedding; M1 ingest tests should use small corpora locally.
  - Vespa M0 schema uses nativeRank only (streaming mode lacks bm25 corpus statistics);
    M1 hybrid ranking needs a deliberate ranking-profile design.
